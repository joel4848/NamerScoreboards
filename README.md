Namer is a simple mod that lets players assign nicknames to themselves.

To give yourself a nickname simply run `/nick <nickname>`
To remove your nickname run `/nick`

Your nickname will appear in chat, the player list, your nametag and can be used to reference you in commands (usage in commands will not cause conflicts).
